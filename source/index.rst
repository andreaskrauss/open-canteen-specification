Goals and Purposes
==================

This project tries to define an open specification for canteens to provide an API for shop and menu information. In contrast to the `Open Mensa <https://openmensa.org/>`__ project, this specification considers additives and allergenes.

This project is based on the aged definition by the Studierendenwerk Ulm in their `Open Food Data <https://github.com/studierendenwerk-ulm/open-food-data>`__.

Use Case
========

In this chapter, you will find a sketch of an UML database model of this specification:
